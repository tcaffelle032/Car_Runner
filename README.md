Game built in Unity for different devices

Remember when you were a kid, riding in your parents car? Sometimes when ya looked out the window you wold imagine a
man running along side it, jumping over things. Well I use to and decided to make a game out of it using Unity.
I am using the 2D physics of Unity to create this game and it will be playable online as well as possibly on mobile devices.
This is my pet project so stay tuned for more stuff everyday.
